Kobilka, a calm, self-effacing and tenacious Stanford Medical Center biochemist, has won this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry, together with his onetime mentor, Robert J. Lefkowitz of Duke University.  The two will share the award for discovering how specialized proteins called receptors carry signals from outside the human body into cells whose activity determines virtually every human response to stimuli like light, smell, touch and - perhaps above all - to drugs.  In 1984, Kobilka, then a Yale Medical School graduate, won a fellowship at the Duke University laboratory headed by Lefkowitz, who was already working on the response of adrenal glands to the hormone adrenaline.  Beta blockers for heart disease, antihistamines for inflammatory disease, drugs against ulcers and drugs that help the immune system fight cancer are all examples of the work of protein receptors whose actions Kobilka and Lefkowitz have revealed.  During a packed news conference at Stanford on Wednesday, Kobilka told reporters how he learned of the Nobel in a 2:20 a.m. phone call Wednesday to his home in Palo Alto from Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences members.  Only two years ago at Stanford, Kobilka and his team captured the first image of a living receptor on a cell membrane as it responded to the hormone adrenalin - the response was a laboratory version of an \"adrenaline rush,\" Kobilka recalled."}, "255": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "256064096544382976", "tweets": ["256064096544382976"], "description": "2 U.S. scientists win Nobel chemistry prize "}, "256": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "256064436211695616", "tweets": ["256064436211695616"], "description": "Nobel prize in chemistry for nailing receptors behind fight-or-flight  via @guardian"}, "257": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "256067485693009920", "tweets": ["256067485693009920"], "description": "A Stanford professor won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry today via @sfgate "}, "258": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "256067829328117763", "tweets": ["256067829328117763"], "description": "Cell receptor research wins Americans chemistry Nobel "}, "259": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "256068945008803840", "tweets": ["256068945008803840"], "description": "American duo win Nobel Prize for chemistry "}, "260": {"type": "img_upload", "origin": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/A429WUmCQAI2aEV.png", "tweets": ["256068945008803840"], "description": "American duo win Nobel Prize for chemistry "}, "261": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "256072573304049664", "tweets": ["256072573304049664"], "description": "\"BOO!\" Cell receptor work wins chemistry Nobel "}, "262": {"type": "news", "origin": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22363-cell-receptor-work-wins-chemistry-nobel/", "tweets": ["256072573304049664", "256272679299080192"], "description": "\"BOO!\" Cell receptor work wins chemistry Nobel  Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka have been awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for identifying receptors that are key to vital physiological responses How cool is this?
