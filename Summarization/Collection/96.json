Nearly 18 months after the Good Friday tornado in April of 2011, church members had more than a new building to share. Theirs was a true story of the triumph of faith over tragedy.\u00a0\u00a0If it seemed like a miracle for the Ferguson Christian Church youth band to be playing outside their new church, then it was the second such miracle here.The 30 or so members in the sanctuary the night of the tornado made it into the basement only a minute or two before it building.\u00a0 No one was hurt.\u201cThe basement ceiling tiles that fell to the floor just had a stench of death.\u00a0 What I held onto, what I clung to was that God wasn\u2019t finished with us,\u201d said church pastor, Stacy Garner.\u201cThe cross was still there.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t a scratch on it.\u00a0 I find it amazing because it\u2019s just metal and glass.\u00a0 It should have gone with the rest of the roof, and it was still there,\u201d said church member Lisa Arconati.As the clean up and restoration crept slowly along, a big part of this story was happening away from this place, in a borrowed church Sunday, after Sunday, after Sunday. Members worshiped at St. Louis Christian College. Pastor Garner kept preaching faith at a time when it was hardest to believe in anything anymore.\u201cFor all of us in this room, it gives us reasons, very important reasons, why we should thank God,\u201d he said during a Mother\u2019s Day 2011 sermon.\u00a0He and church members admitted they did not see this spectacular renovated church coming.\u00a0 But they always believed they were not alone.\u201cGod keeps his promises.\u00a0 When god makes a promise, he keeps it.\u00a0 I knew he would work this out for us,\u201d pastor Garner said.\u00a0After food and fellowship Saturday, they\u2019ll meet for worship in their own church, 10:30 Sunday morning.\u00a0Garner said the church had gone into debt for the repairs and upgrades, but insurance and financial support from other churches covered most the estimated $1.6 million cost.His church said his church had room to grow. There are about 50 members.\u00a0 The church seats about 250.Follow me: on Twitter@andybankertv on Facebook@andybankerfox2 Email: andy.banker@tvstl.com"}, "9": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "257515262763466752", "tweets": ["257515262763466752"], "description": "I liked a @YouTube video  Minecraft Tornado Mod Overview"}, "10": {"type": "website", "origin": "https://www.youtube.com/watch", "tweets": ["257515262763466752"], "description": "I liked a @YouTube video  Minecraft Tornado Mod Overview "}, "11": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "257516055663095808", "tweets": ["257516055663095808"], "description": "I'm reading Justice League of America, Vol. 1: The Tornado's Path  #GetGlue #JusticeLeagueOfAmericaVol1"}, "12": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "257520891532017667", "tweets": ["257520891532017667"], "description": "What do tornadoes and UF grads have in common?\nThey both always end up in trailer parks!"}, "13": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "257523760649871361", "tweets": ["257523760649871361"], "description": "Saw a tornado form while I was driving yesterday!
