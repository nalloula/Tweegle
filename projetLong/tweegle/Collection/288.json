Every night since the car bomb exploded in the Achrafieh district of East Beirut, people have been fighting in the streets. Thick plumes of black smoke are choking the Beirut sky and kids as young as 11 roam around wearing masks, setting shit on fire, and terrifying the local population. I was shot at while driving through Tariq al-Jadida on Friday night, and in a separate incident a friend of mine was shot at 16 times. The anti-Syrian Sunnis of the\u00a0March 14th Alliance\u00a0are making a show of power to their pro-Syrian foes in the\u00a0March 8th Alliance, the latter of whom currently retain a precarious grip on government in Lebanon. Heavy gunfire could be heard around the country, with incidents reported in Naama, Sidon, Tripoli, and all around West Beirut. From what I read, in Naama, Sunni gunmen set up roadblocks and were checking people\u2019s ID cards to find out what sect they belonged to\u2014a throwback to the civil war days.\n\n\n I also read that a person was stabbed and three people\u2014two of them children\u2014were killed during last night\u2019s sectarian clashes. In the Sunni stronghold of Tripoli, a nine-year-old girl was shot in the head by a sniper.\n\n\n \n\n\n General Wissam al-Hassan\u2019s funeral, which took place on the streets of downtown Beirut yesterday afternoon and was attended by thousands, turned into a mass political rally in Martyrs\u2019 Square. Every political group whose flag flies under the banner of the March 14th alliance and that opposes Lebanon\u2019s ruling body\u2019s links to Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Syrian regime was there.\n\n\n At the end of the funeral, popular Lebanese TV presenter Nadim Koteich grabbed a microphone and demanded that the young, angry men in the rally rush to the offices of Prime Minister Najib Mikati and occupy them. \u201cMikati will fall down today,\u201d he shouted. On Saturday, Mikati did indeed hand President Michel Suleiman his resignation, but had been asked to stay on for the time being in the interests of stability. And so, a crowd of several hundred tried to storm police barricades and reach the governmental buildings but were dispersed as police forces fired tear gas and gun rounds, which put two people in the hospital. Many people see Mikati (a Sunni) as a Hezbollah puppet and blame him for not preventing the assassination of the General. As the crowd ran in the streets, they chanted \u201cMikati\u2019s sister\u2019s pussy\u201d in Arabic, which is a less eloquent way of saying \u201cFuck your sister, Mikati.\u201d\n\n\nContinue"}, "128": {"type": "tweet", "origin": "260529856062836736", "tweets": ["260529856062836736"], "description": "SEO Condemns Beirut Bombing Targeting Lebanese Intelligence Official, Stands with Lebanese People in "}, "129": {"type": "news", "origin": "http://www.prweb.com/releases/syrian-expatriate-org/condemns-alhassan-death/prweb10043339.htm", "tweets": ["260529856062836736"], "description": "SEO Condemns Beirut Bombing Targeting Lebanese Intelligence Official, Stands with Lebanese People in  The Syrian Expatriates Organization (SEO) condemns the Beirut car-bombing which killed eight people including Lebanese intelligence official Wissam Al-Hassan.
